# ubuntu-dev-scripts
Random (relatively undocumented) scripts I made to help work on packages in Ubuntu

## Script Overview

#### [lxcquick](./lxcquick)
Create an LXD container of a given Ubuntu version, update it, and enter a shell for it. Once you exit the shell the container will be automatically deleted.
